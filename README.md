# Web Starter Lesson 1

## Overview
This project will help you become familiar with HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Stylesheets). By the end of the project you will have a simple static webpage. 

## 1. HTML
HTML is a considered a declairative language, meaning it is used to describe only what is displayed on a page. It does not describe the control flow for rending the page or the pages possible interactions with a user.
### The Main HTML Components

The `index.html` found in the project contains some basic components that should be included in all html documents.

* `<!DOCTYPE html>` - This is a declairation, not a tag. This tells the broswer which html version to use to interpret the all of the tags within the document. This declairation must be the first thing in the html document.

* `<html></html>` - This tag tells the browser this is an html document. This is important for the broswer to know how to interpret tags within the document, and ultamatly how to display or render the page to the user.

* `<head></head>` - the head tag is the container for head elements. These tags have varied purposes, and we will go into more depth on these later. 

* `<title></title>` - This is pretty self-explainitory. It is used to git your html document a title.

* `<body></body>` - All of the content that will be displayed on your webpage will be defined within the body tags.

* Other tags - Tags like `<h1>`, `<p>` and many more are used to give the content within some predefined styling. As you become familair with HTML, you will see more and more tags, and develop and understand of the use of each tag.

These are the basics of HTML. There are thousands of free resoures availible to learn more HTML. Use those resources for rerference and learning. Here are a few I have found to be useful.

### Exercies
1. Make `index.html` a document about you using heading tags (`<h1>`, `<h2>` ...), paragraph tags (`<p>`), list tags (`<ol>`, `<ul>`), and link tags (`<a>`). Create a section talking about your hobbies. Make an unordered list of things you would like to do at some point in your life. Make an ordered list of your favorite food.

2. Find a picture you like and use the image tag to display it on your page.

3. Create a new HTML document that tells your favorite fable or short story. Include pictures and links. Link to your new page from `index.html`.
